### Bot v2
+ Works on API v3
+ Added money formatting
+ Added option to hack people even when not anonymous (NOT recommended.)
+ Added checking to see if the host is watched by the FBI BEFORE attacking it.

With this update, the bot was forced to not work as efficiently due to the fact that it has to transfer the images to text to process them, which might not always get it right.
Also, the API scripts seem to store some things server-side, such as the current host you are connected to, so you can't run this on multiple devices at the same time.

### Bot v3
+ Works on API v4
+ Password checking changed

Not tested, but possibility for running on proxies again? Less temporary stuff is stored server side now.
